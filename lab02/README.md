# ðŸ”¶ The objective of the exercise ðŸ”¶

<p> The exercise involved implementing the Graham and Jarvis algorithms for computing convex hulls. Then, it was necessary to test their performance on different datasets and measure their execution time. </p>
<p> The algorithms for computing convex hulls were the subject of my semester course on Geometric Algorithms. 
  You can find more implemented algorithms for computing convex hulls <a href="https://github.com/YoC00lig/Convex-Hull">in this repository</a>. </p>

# ðŸ”¶ Results for example dataset ðŸ”¶

<h3> ðŸ”¸ Graham </h3>
<p> The Graham algorithm, also known as the Graham scan, first finds the point with the lowest y-coordinate (or the leftmost point in case of a tie). It then sorts the remaining points based on their polar angle with respect to this point and constructs the convex hull using a stack.</p>

<h3> ðŸ”¸ Jarvis </h3>
<p> The Jarvis algorithm, also known as the gift wrapping algorithm, is a simple approach for computing the convex hull. It starts with the leftmost point and iteratively selects the next point that forms the smallest angle with the current edge. </p>
