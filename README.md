# 🔶 Geometric algorithms course 🔶
Geometric algorithms course at AGH UST. 📚 <br>
Each folder contains an algorithm implementation and a report. 👩‍💻 <br>
The leading programming language during this course: Python. 🐍 <br>
Reports are written in Polish, because whole course was conducted in Polish. 🇵

<h2> 🔶 Table of contents: </h2>
<p> 🔸 lab01 - Geometric predicates </p>
<p> 🔸 lab02 - Convex hull (Graham/Jarvis) </p>
<p> 🔸 lab03 - Triangulating y-monotone polygons </p>
<p> 🔸 lab04 - Segments intersections </p>
